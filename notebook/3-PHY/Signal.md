## Synthesis of Ultra Wide Band Waveforms

Once the propagation channel has been evaluated. This is done in the `pylayers.antprop.channel` module.
The received signal is evaluated in applying a convolution product of each ray tranfer function with a specific
IR-UWB waveform. The necessary modules are

+ `pylayers.signal.bsignal`.
+ `pylayers.signal.waveform`
+ `pylayers.signal.channel`


```python
from pylayers.signal.bsignal import *
from pylayers.signal.waveform import *
from pylayers.antprop.channel import *
```

### Generation of an Impulse of normalized energy

One possible manner to define an energy normalized short UWB impulse is as follows using  `bsignal.TUsignal.EnImpulse` function.

The default waveform is a gaussian windowing of a sine wave of frequency $f_c$. The normalization term depends on the exponential scaling factor $\tau$.

$p(t)= \frac{\sqrt{2\sqrt{2}}}{\tau\sqrt{\pi}} \cos(2\pi f_c t) e^{-(\frac{t}{\tau})^2}$

$\tau = \frac{2}{B\pi}\sqrt{\frac{\gamma_{dB}\ln{10}}{20}}$

where $B$ is the desired bandwidth defined at $\gamma_{dB}$ below the spectrum maximum and $f_c$ is the central frequency of the pulse.

```python
fc     = 4
band   = 2
thresh = 10
fe     = 100
ip     = TUsignal()
ip.EnImpulse(fcGHz=fc,
	     WGHz=band,
             threshdB=thresh,
             feGHz=fe)
```

```python
ip.info()
```

## Verification of energy normalization in both domains

```python
E1= sum(ip.y*ip.y)*ip.dx()
print "Integration in time",E1
```

```python
P = ip.esd()
E2 = sum(P.y)*P.dx()
print "Integration in frequency domain ",E2
```

## Calculation of UWB channel impulse response

We choose to load a simple floor plan.

```python
S = Simul()
S.L = Layout('defstr3.ini')
```

A simulation object has an `info` method providing a summary of simulation informations.

```python
st = S.wav.st
sf = S.wav.sf
S.wav.info()
```

The waveform associated with the simulation object is

```python
S.wav
```

```python
S.wav.show()
```

Above the waveform is a generic UWB waveform. The interested user can add
easyly any other mathematical expression of UWB waveform for investigation on
pulse waveform modulation for example. The waveform can also comes from
measurement. For now there are two versions of this waveform which has been used
during the M1 measurement campaign. One is not compensated `W1compensate` for
an extra short delay which can introduse a bias when interpretating the
observed delay in terms of distance. The non compensated version is `W1offset`
from the time origin about 0.7 ns.

The waveform class should grow for incorporating more waveforms, especially
waveforms compliants with the IEEE 802.15.4a and IEEE 802.15.6
standards.

```python
wavmeasured = Waveform(typ='W1compensate')
wavmeasured.show()
```

```python
wavmeasured = Waveform(typ='W1offset')
wavmeasured.show()
```

Here the time domain waveform is measured and the anticausal part of the signal is artificially set to 0.

To handle properly the time domain wavefom in PyLayers, it is required to
center the signal in the middle of the array.  The waveform has embedded in the
object its frequency domain and time domain representation.

+ `st` member stands for signal in time domain
+ `sf` member stands for signal in frequency domain

```python
print type(S.wav.sf)
print type(S.wav.st)
```

+ `FUsignal` Frequency domain uniformly sampled base signal
+ `TUsignal` Time domain uniformly sampled base signal

## Construction of the propagation channel

The following representation shows the spatial spreading of the propagation
channel.  On the left are scattered the intensity of rays wrt to angles of
departure (in azimut and elevation).
On the right is the intensity of rays w.r.t to angles of arrival. It misses the application between the 2
planes as well as the delay dimension of the propagation channel.

```python
from pylayers.antprop.signature import *
from pylayers.antprop.channel import *
```

```python
S.L.build()
```

```python
S.L
```

```python
S.L.Gt.pos
```

```python
tx=np.array([759,1114,1.0])
rx=np.array([767,1114,1.5])
ctx = S.L.pt2cy(tx)
crx = S.L.pt2cy(rx)
```

The sequence of command below :

+ initialize a signature between cycle ctx and cycle crx
+ evaluates the signature with a given cutoff value
+ calculates a set of 2D rays from signature and tx/rx coordinates
+ calculates a set of 3D ray from 2D rays and layout and ceil height (default H=3m)
+ calculates local basis and various geometric information out of the 3D ray and Layout
+ fill and reorganize the interactions object with proper material chararcteristics

```python
Si = Signatures(S.L,ctx,crx)
Si.run5(cutoff=5)
r2d = Si.rays(tx,rx)
r3d = r2d.to3D(S.L)
r3d.locbas(S.L)
r3d.fillinter(S.L)
```

Define a frequency base in GHz.

```python
fGHz = np.arange(2,10,0.01)
```

Evaluate the propagation channel $\tilde{\mathbf{C}}$. Here the meaning of
tilde is that the complex value of the channel do not include the phase term
due to delay along the ray.

```python
C = r3d.eval(fGHz)
```

## Construction of the transmission channel

The transmission channel is obtained from the combination of the propagation
channel $\tilde{\mathbf{C}}$ and the vector antenna pattern at both side of the
radio link. This operation is implemented in the `prop2tran` method of the
`Ctilde` class.

```python
sc = C.prop2tran()
```

The transmission channel is obtained by applying a vector radiation pattern using an antenna file.

In the presented case, it comes from a real antenna which has been used during
the **FP7 project WHERE1** measurement campaign M1.

```python
sc
```

The antenna radiation pattern is stored in a very compact way thanks to Vector
Spherical Harmonics decomposition.  The following gives information about the
content of the antenna object.

```python
S.tx.A.info()
```

The figure below plot on a same graph all the tansfer function in modulus and
phase of the ray transfer function.

If a realistic antenna is applied it gives

```python
sca = C.prop2tran(S.tx.A,S.rx.A)
```

## Calculate UWB Channel Impulse Response

Once the transmission channel has been evaluated on can convolved the waveform
with the channel impulse response to get the received waveform.

```python
r = sca.applywavB(S.wav.sfg)
```

```python
r.y
```

```python
fig,ax = r.plot(typ=['l20'])
plt.axis([15,90,-120,-60])
plt.title(u'Received Waveform $r(t)$')
```

```python
r.plot(typ=['v'])
#plt.axis([15,60,-0.3,0.3])
... plt.title(u'Received Waveform $r(t)$')
```

## Hermitian symetry enforcment

If the number of point for the transmission channel and the waveform were the same the mathematical operation is an Hadamrd-Shur product between
$\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{W}$.

$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{S} \odot \mathbf{W}$

In practice this is what is done after a resampling of the time base with a reinterpolated  time step.

The process which consists in going from time domain to frequency domain is delegated to a specialized class `pylayers.signal.bsignal.Bsignal` which maintains the proper
binding between signal samples and their indexation either in time or in frequency domain.

```python
wgam = S.wav.sfg
Y    = sc.apply(wgam)
tau  = Y.taud
dod = Y.dod
doa = Y.doa
```

The transmission channel has a member data which is the time delay of each path in nano seconds. Notice that by default those delay are not sorted.

```python
print 'tau =', tau[0:20]
```

```python
h = plt.hist(tau,20)
```

Direction of arrival $(\theta_r,\phi_r)$ in radians

```python
print "doa = ", doa[1:10,:]
```

```python
plt.subplot(221)
ht = plt.hist(doa[:,0],20)
plt.xlabel(u'$\\theta_r$')
plt.ylabel('#')
plt.subplot(222)
hp = plt.hist(doa[:,1],20)
plt.xlabel(u'$\phi_r$')
plt.ylabel('#')
plt.subplot(223)
ht = plt.hist(dod[:,0],20)
plt.xlabel(u'$\\theta_t$')
plt.ylabel('#')
plt.subplot(224)
hp = plt.hist(dod[:,1],20)
plt.xlabel(u'$\phi_t$')
plt.ylabel('#')
plt.tight_layout()
```
